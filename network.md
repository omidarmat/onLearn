# Network protocols to use when you implement a network

## Network protocols

A network protocol is a set of **conditions** and **rules** that specify how network devices communicate on a given network. It provides a common framework for establishing and maintaining a **communications channel**, and how to handle errors or faults should they occur. Network protocols allow communication between different network-enabled devices, such as laptops, tablets, smartphones, desktops, servers, and other network-enabled devices.
