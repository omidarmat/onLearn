# Basics of SQL

## Creating a table

In order to create a table you can use this query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE cities (
    name VARCHAR(50),
    country VARCHAR(50),
    population INTEGER,
    area INTEGER
);
```

> You should be mindful of using the ',' and ';' characters in their right position.

## Inserting rows

In order to insert records (rows) into the table, you can use this query:

```sql
INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population, area)
VALUES ('Tokyo', 'Japan', 38505000, 8223);
```

To insert multiple records in one go you can use this query:

```sql
INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population, area)
VALUES
    ('Delhi', 'India', 28125000, 2240),
    ('Shanghai', 'China', 22125000, 4015),
    ('Sao Paulo', 'Brazil', 20935000, 3043);
```

## Retrieve data

Retrieving data from an SQL table can be very complicated, but let's stick to the basics now.

### With `SELECT`

You can retrieve raw data from the database, or you can make the database calculate some data before returning it to you.

#### Retrieve raw columns

To retrieve data using the `SELECT` statement you can use this query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cities;
```

Where `*` means every column. But you can also specify which data columns your want to retrieve:

```sql
SELECT name, country FROM cities;
```

#### Retrieve calculated columns

To retrieve calculated columns based on the raw data that exists in the table, you can use this query:

```sql
SELECT name, population / area FROM cities;
```

You will see in the results that the caluclated column has a title of `?column?`. You can rename the calculated column using this query:

```sql
SELECT name, population / area AS population_density
FROM cities;
```

> You can also use other math **operators** like `+`, `-`, `\*`, `/`, `^`, `|/` (square root), `@` (absolute value), `%` (remainder).

To manipulate string columns before being returned, you can use string operators or functions. For instance:

```sql
SELECT name || ', ' || country FROM cities;
```

> Note that you can use string constants (`', '` in the example above ) when manipulating string columns using string operators.

> There are also string **operators** and **functions** that you can use to manipulate string columns. These are `||` (join two strings), `CONCAT()` (join two strings), `LOWER()` (gives a lowercase string), `LENGTH()` (gives number of characters in a string), `UPPER()` (gives an uppercase string).

To use the `CONCAT()` string function to receive the exact result of the example above, you can use this query:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(name, ', ', country) AS location
FROM cities;
```

You can stack as many string functions as you need in your query. For instance:

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(UPPER(name), ', ', UPPER(country)) AS location
FROM
  cities;
```

As another example:

```sql
SELECT
  UPPER(CONCAT(name, ', ', country)) AS location
FROM
  cities;
```

### Filtering rows

#### With `WHERE`

To filter rows, you can use the `WHERE` statement after `FROM`, which is where you define which table you are retrieving data from.

```sql
SELECT name, area FROM cities WHERE area > 4000
```

You may need to understand how the three parts of this query is executed by SQL in order to fully get how it works. So it just does not start from the beginning and proceed to the end. It starts from the `FROM` statement, then goes to the `WHERE` statement, and finally to the `SELECT` statement. Understanding this will help you write more complicated queries.

> Note that the query syntax formatting of the example above can also be like this:

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  area
FROM
  cities
WHERE
  area > 4000
```

> To filter rows you can use many comparison math operators like `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `IN` (is the value present in a list?), `<>` (are the values not equal), `!=`, `BETWEEN` (is the value between two other values?), `NOT IN` (is the value not present in a list?).

Let's use the `BETWEEN` operator:

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  area
FROM
  cities
WHERE
  area BETWEEN 2000 AND 4000;
```

Let's use the `IN` and `NOT IN` operator:

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  area
FROM
  cities
WHERE
  name IN ('Delhi', 'Shanghai');
```

> Note that you are not limited to use strings with the `IN` and `NOT IN` operator.

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  area
FROM
  cities
WHERE
  area NOT IN (8223, 3043);
```

> You can use as many operators in one `WHERE` statement. This is called a _Compound check_ where you can use as many `AND` and `OR` statements. Here is an example:

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  area
FROM
  cities
WHERE
  area NOT IN (8223, 3043)
  OR name = 'Delhi'
  OR name = 'Tokyo';
```

In this query you want to find all the cities that does not have an area of `8223` or `3043`, `AND` also the city must have the name `Delhi`.

> You can perform calculations in the `WHERE` statement. You just need to keep in mind that the order of execution in the filtering statement is prioritised for mathematical calculations and then comparisons. In the example below, `population` will be divided by `aread` and then the result will be compared to `6000`.

```sql
SELECT
	name,
  population / area AS population_density
FROM
	cities
WHERE
	population / area > 6000
```

> Remember that you cannot refer to the renamed calculated columns with their provided name in the `WHERE` statement. You can only refer to them by doing the calculation again in the `WHERE` statement.

## Update rows

To update a row in a table, you should use the `UPDATE` statement with the table name, and then the `SET` statement with the updating property along with its new value. Finally you have to specify which row you want to update by filtering the rows using the `WHERE` statement. So as an example:

```sql
UPDATE
  cities
SET
  population = 39505000
WHERE
  name = 'Tokyo';
```

> Remember that if you are trying to update only one specific row, the `WHERE` statement you write should be specific enough to target only one record in the table. This can become a bit tricky sometimes. There is a nice solution for this problem. [later...]

## Delete rows

To delete a specific row from a table, you should use the `DELETE FROM` statement followed by the table name, and then the `WHERE` statement that defines the row that is going to be deleted.

```sql
DELETE FROM cities
WHERE name = 'Tokyo';
```

> Remember that if you are trying to update only one specific row, the `WHERE` statement you write should be specific enough to target only one record in the table. This can become a bit tricky sometimes. There is a nice solution for this problem. [later...]

# Working with tables

Things are going to get closer to real-world conditions now. We are going to work with multiple tables in one database. In this part of this tutorial we are going to design a database for a photo-sharing application.

## Approaching database design

Let's talk about a few tips that would help you come up with your own database design that would suit your application needs.

The most important question you want to as yourself is: **What Tables should we make?**

A lot of time for any application you make, chances are it is going to have many features that are common among many other applications. There are many features out in the world (e.g. authentication, liking system, commenting systems) that many different web apps implement. Therefore, there are tons of resources online to give you suggestions on how to structure your database to implement these features.

However, you are probably going to create an app with some features that no one has ever built. To address this case, you need to take a look at some mockups of your application to see what the user interface looks like and what is the purpose of your application. Out goal here is to identify the different kinds of resources that exists inside your app. So you need to as yourself: **What type of resources exist in your app?** Then as the first step, you might want to create a separate table for each of these features or resources.

Then for each of these resources, you might want to find relationship or ownership between two types of resources. These relationships must be reflected in the database design. This is only achievable in a practical example.

Take Instagram as an example. To design the database for Instagram, we need 4 tables: users, photos, comments, likes. We also know that each user can own comments, photos and likes. We also know that photos own comments and likes by users. These are the relationships.

To represent relationships, we need some data somewhere that says, for instnace, that some specific photos belong to a specific user. We should now learn about 4 different kinds of relationships.

### Types of relationships

1. One-to-Many: for example, a user can own many photos. Also, a photo can have many different comments tied to it.
2. One-to-One: for example, a boat can only have one captain. A company can only have one CEO. A CEO can relate to only one company at a time. A student has one desk, and a desk can only belong to one student.
3. Many-to-Many: this is a bit trickier. For example, many students may be related to many classes. Many tasks may be assigned to many engineers. Many movies have many actors in them. Multiple sessions of conference calls can involve multiple employees.
4. Many-to-One: it is kind of the opposite direction of One-to-Many relationship. Many different comments can belong to one photo.

#### Primary keys

Primary keys are additional columns that you add to a lot of different tables inside all the different database your create. Every single table you make will have a primary key. The goal of a primary key is to identify an individual row inside a table. Every value inside the primary key volumn is going to be some kind of a unique value in that column. It is basically the ID of each row.

#### Foreign key

To set up a relationship between two different records, you should use a foreign key. The goal of a foreign key is to relate a record in a table, to another record in possibly another table or even in the same table.

##### Example 1: One-to-One relationship

For instance, imagine we have a table of photos and users. So to represent the relationship between a user and a photo, we should insert a foreign key of `user_id` for each record (row) in the photos table. This way, each photo will be related to a specific user. This way you would be able to query for all the photos related to a specific user (for instance, user with ID of 4).

##### Example 2: One-to-Many relationship

For instance, imaine a system like Instagram where comments are related to users and also comments are relate to a photos. Comments have one user and comments have one photo. Looking at the oposite direction, we would say that a user has many comments, and a photo has many comments. We now have to decide which table will receive the foreign keys. Here is the key: **The many side of our relationship is always going to get the foreign key column**. So now that we know a photo can have many comments, the many side is the comments. So the comments table will get the foreign keys pointing at a photo.

#### Wrap up

##### Primary keys

1. Each row in every table has one primary key
2. No other row in the same table can have the same value
3. 99% of the time is called 'id'
4. It would be either an integer or a UUID
5. It will never change

##### Foreign keys

1. Rows only have this if they belong to another record
2. Many rows in the same table can have the same foreign key
3. Name varies, usually called something like 'xyz_id'
4. Exactly equal to the primary key of the referenced row
5. It will change if the relationship changes

#### Autogenerated IDs

When we implement a table that should have a primary key column, we can use a Postres feature which automatically creates a random ID when a new record is inserted into the row. To do this, we create the table with this syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50)
);
```

So `SERIAL` data type tells Postgres that we want it to generated values for this column automatically. This way, when we want to insert a new user into this table, we won't have to give it an ID. The ID will be generated automatically.

Let's now add some data to this table:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username)
VALUES
	('monahan93'),
  ('pfeffer'),
  ('si93onis'),
  ('99stroman');
```

Now if you use this command to take a look at all your records in this table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
```

You will see that each row has a unique ID which is number. It starts from 1 for the first user to 4 for the last.

#### Creating the foreign keys column

Following the previous example, we are now going to create a photos table where we are going to store a foreign key of `user_id` for each photo record.

```sql
CREATE TABLE photos (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  url VARCHAR(200),
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
  );
```

Note that the foregin key column is define as the `user_id`, which holds the `INTEGER` value type, which `REFERENCES` to the `id` column of the `users` table. Marking a column as foreign key enforces some level of data consistency.

Let's now insert rows into this table.

```sql
INSERT INTO photos(url, user_id)
VALUES
	('http://two.jpg', 1),
  ('http://three.jpg', 1),
  ('http://four.jpg', 1),
  ('http://five.jpg', 2),
  ('http://six.jpg', 3),
  ('http://six.jpg', 4);
```

We can now see that in the record of this photo in the table, we have a `user_id` of `4`. ut how is this going to help us with the relationship? There two big advantages here:

1. We can start to write a lot of interesting queries that allow us to fetch all the different photos that are associated with a user.
2. We also start to get a little bit of data consistency.[later...]

##### Retrieve by the foreign key (`JOIN`)

Let's now write some query that uses the foreign key that we implemented.

To fetch all the photos related to a user with id of `4`. We can do it in a simple way.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  photos
WHERE
  user_id = 4;
```

But let's now actually utilize the foreign key of each photo, and list the photos along with the username that owns the photo. So we want to receive a list of photos where, instead of some integers as `user_id`s, actual usernames are listed. So what we want basically is to get images from the photos table and usernames from the users table and get them in one new table as a result of a query. This means that we need to somehow `JOIN` the two tables. We will explain more about this complicated syntax later. [later...]

```sql
SELECT url, username FROM photos
JOIN users ON users.id = photos.user_id;
```
