## Image data basics

An image consists of two-diemensional array of numbers. The color or gray shade displayed for a given picture element (pixel) depends on the number stored in the array for that pixel. The simplest type of image is black and white. It is a binary image since each pixel is either 0 or 1.

The next more complex type of image data is gray scale, where each pixel takes on a value between zero and the number of gray scales or gray levels that the scanner can record. These images appear like common black and white photographs. Most grayscale images today have 256 shades of gray. Human eye can distinguish about 40 shades of gray, so a 256-shade image looks like a photograph.
